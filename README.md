# Project Chaos: The Entropy Engine

Welcome to the official dashboard for monitoring universal entropy levels. This application tracks the breakdown of order across our designated sectors.

### Current Build Status: UNSTABLE

**Known Issues:**
- The 'Chaos Injector' button seems to be lowering the entropy instead of raising it. Our junior engineer might have flipped the polarity.
- The dashboard layout collapses into a mess on smaller screens because of a z-index conflict in the navigation.
- Data persistence is non-existent. Refreshes wipe the entropy logs.

**Your Mission:** Stabilize the engine and fix the logic errors before the heat death of the universe (or the end of the sprint).
